# LINA - LinkedIn Network Analyzer

LINA is a CLI tool that can be used to discover and gain insights about your LinkedIn Network.

It uses the `connections.csv` from your [LinkedIn data export](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a566336/export-connections-from-linkedin) to populate a local database with the assistance of [Apify Actors](https://apify.com), providing publically available profile data for search, discovery, and organization.

### Use Cases

- Discover leads for a job hunt via a person-first or company-first search where you can identify companies of interest based on filters like `specialties`, `industries`, `employee size`
- Statistical breakdown of your network composition, providing insights for factors like companies you have the most connections to, what university your connections graduated from, most common title keywords, and more.

## Installation

Download the latest release zip archive for your target operating system and extract the contents. Run the lina executable and the app will give you instructions on getting started.
